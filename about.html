  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>I am an aspiring Software Engineer, from a very young age I have taken up an interest in computers and technology. Software Development has always been a huge interest for me, however with limited resources I could never follow this passion. With HyperionDev, I was able to gain the skills to get my career started. I can remember the excitement I felt when starting my course and to this point I am more curious than ever. From printing "Hello World" to creating code for a fully operating Task Managing system, my drive has always been pushed beyond its peak. I am always looking to learn more. I work well in a team as well as independently and am able to communicate in English and Afrikaans. My skills at the moment are Phython and Java with a beginner's knowledge in Github and Version Control. I hope to land a Software Engineering career to further my knowledge and learn new languages and algorithms in the process.
  <br>What motivates me most is my family, namely my son and partner, giving them a life they can enjoy and be proud of is what fills my drive. What i like doing most is playing playing sport.
